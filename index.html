//   1.  Guess what letter I'm thinking of

// 2. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

// 2. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

// 3. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

// 4. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

// 5. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

// 6. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
